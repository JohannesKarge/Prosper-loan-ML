# Credit Default and Borrower Clusters in the Prosper Loan Data Set: A Machine Learning Approach

 We use the Prosper loan data set with more than 80 features and +11000 entries on the characteristics of individual loans and borrowers such as initial amount, risk rating or interest rate charged to implement a machine learning approach in Python to analyze and predict defaults. We employ Logistic Regression, a Decision Tree Classifier as well as a k-Means algorithm to answer the following questions: 1) Who will default on their loan? and 2) Can we identify meaningful clusters of borrowers based on their features?

Being aware of the unbalanced data at hand, we find that the borrower-specific interest rate charged, loan purpose and the borrower's employment status are key features to predict default. Cluster analysis reveals a high risk-high reward segment of small scale loans as well as a low risk segment constituted of different loan sizes.
